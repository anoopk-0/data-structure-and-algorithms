/**
 *  A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Each node consist of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node.
 *
 * The list element can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.
 *
 * Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.
 *
 * The linked list data structure supports three main operations
 *      - insertion - to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the time
 *      - deletion - to remove an item given its index or value
 *      - search - to find an element given its value
 *
 *
 * Linked list Usage
 * All application of both stacks and queues are application of linked list
